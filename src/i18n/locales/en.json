Red indicates lower-than-expected levels of function while blue indicates higher-than-expected levels.",

  "IEEGSummaryReportBrainAgingScoreTitle": "Analyzing Brain Function by Hemisphere",
  "IEEGSummaryReportBrainAgingScoreDescription": "Each lobal function score is calculated by theta to beta ratio and standardized comparing to same age/sex normative reference DB. Taking 50 as the average, scores below 50 indicate relatively lower functioning, while scores above 50 indicate relatively higher functioning. \n\nSuppressed score could be caused by drowsiness, dopamine deficiency, concussion, neurodegeneration (e.g., Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease), infarction or ischemic injury.",

The farther each colored dot is from the center of the contours, the more your brain function differs from that of your peers. Dots in the upper left indicate a higher-than-normal function for an area of your brain. Dots in the lower right indicate lower-than-normal function",

  "IGasPhaseLevel3Description": "The stress level has increased to a noticeable amount which now is a possible threat to your health. The body is resisting stress by \nincreasing the variability to its maximum extent to decrease the \nburdens of stress. The autonomic nervous system activity also \nfollows the heart rate variability increase. The sympathetic nervous system shows a steady increase, and parasympathetic nervous values show declination. You may experience sharpened senses and \nanxiety, nervousness due to the factors described above.",
  "IGasPhaseLevel4Description": "The stress is now significantly accumulated in your body. You may experience tension in your body including sore muscle, sleep disorder, lack of focus. The maximized heart rate variability will slowly decline as your body is unable to keep up with the current \nenvironment.

  "IRoiO3": "Pericalcarine",
  "IRoiO3Feature": "- Responsible for primary processing of visual information. \n- Able to recognize whether an object is moving or stationary, as well as its shape, color, and texture. ",
  "IRoiO3Example": "- Information such as the movement, shape, and color of an object can be recognized. i.e.) a green car is entering the right alley at high-speed.",
  "IRoiO3Symptom": "- Poor visual perception. \n- Poor recognition of the shape and movement of objects.",
  "IRoiO4": "Lingual",
  "IRoiO4Feature": "- Recognize the letters and texts we use.\n- Responsible for matching visual information with the previously memorized information. \nIt is crucial for the identification and recognition of the word.\n- Contributes to visualization of a person's dream.",
  "IRoiO4Example": "- If the intelligence level is developed normally, the person feels comfortable reading and writing letters.",
  "IRoiO4Symptom": "- Normal hearing and speaking, but difficult to read texts (dyslexia).\n- Possible symptoms of visual snow syndrome.",
